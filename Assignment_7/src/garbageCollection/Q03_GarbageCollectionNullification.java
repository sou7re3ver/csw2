/*Q3. Write a Java program illustrating nullification of references and garbage collection using
the NullifiedReference class. This class comprises a constructor initializing an object with a
provided name. Within the main() method, an instance of NullifiedReference is created and
assigned, followed by a nullification of the object reference. Subsequently, the garbage
collector is explicitly invoked. Furthermore, the program overrides the finalize() method to
print the name of the object upon successful garbage collection*/
